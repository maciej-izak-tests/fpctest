This directory demonstrates the use of a fpdoc project file.
It uses the files in the examples/simple directory.

The project file contains the names of the files with relative paths.
That means that fpdoc must be executed from this directory:

fpdoc --project=sample-project.xml

The docs will be written to a subdirectory doc. 
This directory can be deleted if it is no longer necessary.
