  { The Win16 C headers define the P-prefixed types - PSTR, etc. as near pointers.
    Borland Pascal 7 defines them as far pointers (in other words, the same as the
    LP-prefixed type - LPSTR)  We define them as the default pointer type for the
    current memory model. This means we'll be BP7 compatible in the large memory
    model (which is the only memory model supported by BP7).

    Also, using memory models other than 'large' under win16 is somewhat nasty and
    is better to be avoided. }
